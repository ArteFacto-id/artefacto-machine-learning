# ArteFacto Machine Learning

Welcome to **ArteFacto Machine Learning**, where we are building a powerful image recognition model for the Prambanan Temple statues. Our goal is to enhance understanding and appreciation of the temple's rich cultural heritage through cutting-edge technology.

## Dataset

Our dataset, which includes high-quality images of the statues at Prambanan Temple, is available on our [Drive ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1REQhQLxiZOUIh9l7CW7M9ALAsBwUllRa?usp=drive_link). It contains detailed labeled images for classification, which are crucial for training and improving the accuracy of our machine learning model.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the dataset as we continue to refine our approach.
